# LinkedInScraper

The purpose for this program is to figure out which progamming languages, frameworks and libararies are in demand from employers on Linkedin.

The program takes in a URL of a keyword search on the linkedin jobs page and pulls every job ID from the search results. 

Then it uses each job ID to access the individual job page and adds the description of every job to a string.

Then it counts how many times each language, framework or library appears in each description and creates a table.
