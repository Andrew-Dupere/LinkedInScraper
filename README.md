# LinkedInScraper

The purpose for this program is to figure out which progamming languages, frameworks and libararies are in demand on Linkedin.

The program takes in a URL of a keyword search on the linkedin jobs page and pulls every job ID from the search results. 

Then it uses each job ID to access the individual job page and pulls the description of every job.

Then it counts how many times each language, framework or library appears in each description.
